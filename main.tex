\begin{abstract}
  State channels are an important technique for scaling blockchains, allowing a fixed set of participants to jointly run an application in order to determine how a set of assets should be distributed between them.
  In this paper, we present a new protocol for constructing state channel networks, allowing state channels to be opened and closed without on-chain transactions and decreasing the number of deposits that need to be held.
  The protocol readily extends to $n$-party channels and we include the construction of a 3-party virtual channel.
