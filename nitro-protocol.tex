\section{Nitro Protocol}

Nitro protocol is an extension to Turbo protocol.
In Nitro protocol, the outcome of a channel can be either an allocation or a \textbf{guarantee}.
There are two on-chain redistribution operations: the transfer and the \textbf{claim}.

Nitro enables true state channel networks by allowing virtual channels, where channels are routed through intermediaries.
In particular, the extra features of Nitro allow virtual channels to be safely opened and closed off-chain while maintaining the property that channels update independently\footnote{It is possible to implement virtual channels in Turbo but only by breaking the constraint that channels update independently. We believe this constraint will be important when running large scale state channel networks.}.

\subsection{Guarantees and Claims}

In the section on Turbo, we introduced allocations which defined a set of destinations and totals owed to them, along with a priority order in which the destinations should receive their funds.
In Nitro, we allow for these two concerns to be split between different types of channels, with
one type of channel providing the destinations and totals and another type of channel specifying the priority order.
This opens up the possibility of having more than one priority order for the same allocation.

The new type of channels are called \textbf{guarantee channels} and their outcomes are known as \textbf{guarantees}.
A guarantee \textbf{targets} an allocation, while specifying a different priority order to pay out to the destinations.
The funds held in a guarantee channel can only be paid out once the outcome of the target channel is finalized.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{figures/guarantee-notation}}
  \caption{
    Guarantee notation.
    The guarantee outcome of $G$ is written $\guar{L}{B}$, where $L$ is the allocation it targets and $B$ is an address to be prioritized first.
    When targeted by a guarantee we draw the allocation, $L$, as a lower semicircle.
    The guarantee, $G$, is drawn as an upper semicircle. 
    The lines between $G$ and $L$ depict the reprioritization, showing that the highest priority position of $G$ (on the bottom left of the semicircle) will pay out to $B$.
  }
  \label{fig:guarantee-notation}
\end{figure}


The format for specifying the priority order of a guarantee channels is complicated by the fact that we may not know the precise outcome or even the precise set of destinations at the time the guarantee is created.
Because of this we need to enable the guarantee to apply a range of outcomes.
To do this, the guarantee provides a list of addresses, with the rule that these addresses will be moved to the top of the priority order if they appear in the outcome.
For example, if we have the guarantee $\guar{L}{A, B, C}$ and the outcome of $L$ is $\alloc{C: 1, D:2, A:4}$, then the guarantee will pay out as though the outcome was $\alloc{A:4, C:1, D: 2}$.

Extending the terminology for allocations, we say that a guarantee `$G$ \textbf{can afford} $x$ for $B$', if $B$ would receive at least $x$ coins, were the coins currently held by $G$ to be paid out according to $G$'s prioritization of its target.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{figures/claim-operation}}
  \caption{
    The claim operation is used to move funds out of a guarantee.
    Note that in diagram notation, we update the reprioritization lines to reflect the new outcome: after the claim, $L$ only allocates to Bob, so there is only one line from $G$ to $L$.
  }
  \label{fig:claim-operation}
\end{figure}

Nitro adds the \textbf{claim} operation, $\claim{G}{A}{x}$, to the existing transfer, deposit and withdraw operations.
If $G$ acts as guarantee for $L$ and can afford $x$ for $A$, then $\claim{G}{A}{x}$ has the following three effects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduces the funds held in channel $G$ by $x$.
  \item Increases the funds held in channel $A$ by $x$.
  \item Reduces the amount owed to $A$ in the outcome of $L$ by $x$.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, the claim operation has no effect.


\subsection{Redistributing}

Reasoning about redistribution in Nitro is more complicated than in Turbo.
For a start, it is possible to construct situations where the same outcome can lead to different values, depending on the order in which guarantees are claimed.
Figure \ref{fig:claim-redistribution-problem} shows one of these situations.
\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{figures/claim-redistribution-problem}}
  \caption{
    Guarantee claim ordering problem.
    In the diagram both $G_1$ and $G_2$ guarantee $J$'s outcome with $I$ as first priority but with different second priorities.
    If $G_1$ is claimed first, then when $G_2$ is claimed the funds go to $B$.
    If $G_2$ is claimed first (not shown), then when $G_1$ is claimed the funds go to $A$.
    Whether $A$ or $B$ ultimately gets paid depends on the order that the guarantees are claimed.
  }
  \label{fig:claim-redistribution-problem}
\end{figure}

Despite this issue, it is still possible to make some statements about redistribution in Nitro, in particular putting some lower bounds on how funds are distributed.
For example, in the example in figure \ref{fig:claim-redistribution-problem} one thing we can definitely say is that participant $I$ will receive their 5 coins, even though we cannot say anything about how the remaining 5 coins will be distributed between $A$ and $B$.
These lower bounds prove to be enough to handle the constructions used in the rest of the chapter.

\textbf{Nitro Lower-bound Value Algorithm}

We can calculate this lower bound with a modification the Turbo Value Algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Choose a topological ordering, \texttt{OrderedNodes}, for the network.
  \item Create a mapping, \texttt{Values}, from \texttt{OrderedNodes} to $\mathbb{Z}^+$. Initialize this mapping by setting $\texttt{Values}[n]$ to be the balance held for $n$ in the adjudicator, for each $n \in \texttt{OrderedNodes}$ (with $\texttt{Values}[n] = 0$ if $n$'s address does not appear).
  \item For each $n \in \texttt{OrderedNodes}[n]$ (taken in order):
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $n$ is a guarantee channel, do nothing.
    \item Otherwise, $n$ is an allocation channel:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Run the Minimum Payout Calculation on $n$ and the guarantees that target it, to calculate the minimum payouts, \texttt{MinPayouts}, for each of destination channels.
      \item For each destination, $d$, increase $\texttt{Value}[d]$ by $\texttt{MinPayouts}[d]$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Then $\texttt{Values}[n]$ gives the value of node $n$.
\end{enumerate}

Note that by taking the minimum independently on different allocation/guarantee groupings, we end up with an algorithm that strictly underestimates the actual value in some cases.
This is not the case for any of the constructions presented in this paper.

\textbf{Minimum Payout Calculation}

In this calculation we will consider an allocation channel, $L$, whose outcome allocates $a_1 \dots a_m$ to destination addresses $D_1 \dots D_m$, and a set of guarantees $G_1 \dots G_n$ which target $L$.
We want to calculate the minimum payout, $p_i$, that each destination will receive when all possible payout orders are considered.

Each guarantee, $G_i$, induces a permutation $\pi_i$ on the destination addresses, so that $G_i$ prioritizes the outcomes in the order $D_{\pi_i(1)} \dots D_{\pi_i(m)}$.

We start in a state where the values of channel $L$ and the guarantees are known, with $G_i$ having value $v_i = \texttt{Value}[G_i]$.
We will assume the value of $L$ itself is 0. 
We are free to do this because, if $\texttt{Value}[L] = x > 0$, then for the purpose of running the algorithm we can write the problem in an equivalent way, by adding a guarantee $G_{n+1}$ that has value $x$, that targets $L$ and that has $\pi_{n+1}(k) = k$.

If $\sum v_i > \sum a_j$, then we say the system is overfunded. 
In this case, we know that all destinations will receive their allocations, so $p_i = a_i$ regardless of the order of payout.
Otherwise, we let $p_{ij} > 0$ be the amount paid out from guarantee $G_i$ to destination $D_j$ and introduce the following set of constraints to ensure that we only consider situations where no funds are left in the guarantees:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{j} p_{ij} = v_i
\end{equation}

It is useful to introduce the deficit, $\delta_j > 0$, for the destination $D_j$, defined by the equations:
\begin{equation}
  \delta_j + \sum_{i} p_{ij} = a_j
\end{equation}

Finally we can write down the set of constraints that encode the priority order of the guarantees:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  p_{i\pi_j(2)} > 0 &\Rightarrow \delta_{\pi_j(1)} = 0 \\
  p_{i\pi_j(3)} > 0 &\Rightarrow \delta_{\pi_j(2)} = \delta_{\pi_j(1)}  = 0 \\
  &\vdots \\
  p_{i\pi_j(m)} > 0 &\Rightarrow \delta_{\pi_j(m-1)} = \dots = \delta_{\pi_j(1)}  = 0 
\end{split}
\end{align}
Note that we can rewrite these constraints in product form, e.g. $p_{i\pi_j(3)}(\delta_{\pi_j(2)} + \delta_{\pi_j(1)}) = 0$, making it clear that they are non-linear.

We can then calculate $p_i = a_i - \delta_i^*$, where $\delta^*_i$ is found by minimising $\delta_i$ subject to these constraints.

In general, calculating the minimimum payout therefore involves solving a constrained optimization problem, with non-linear constraints.
In practice, for all the calculations required for the constructions in this paper, it is sufficient to look at two special cases: (i) when the allocation is fully funded and (ii) when there is only a single guarantee.
In the fully funded case, where $\sum v_i = \sum a_i$, it is easy to see that $p_i = a_i$, just as in the overfunded case.
In the single guarantee case, the payouts are fully determined, so it is easy to calculate the minimum payout.

\subsection{Virtual Channels}

A virtual channel is a channel between two participants who do not have a shared on-chain deposit, supported through an intermediary.
We will now give the construction for the simplest possible virtual channel, between $A$ and $B$ through a shared intermediary, $I$.
Our starting point for this channel is a pair of ledger channels, $L$ and $L'$, with participants $\{A,I\}$ and $\{B,I\}$ respectively.
\begin{align}
  \adj{\holds{L}{x}{}, \holds{L'}{x}{}}, \; \finalizable{L}{\alloc{A:a, I:b}}{A, I}, \; \finalizable{L'}{\alloc{B: b, I: a}}{B, I} \label{eq:virtual-channel-start-state}
\end{align}
where $x = a + b$.
The participants want to use the existing deposits and ledger channels to fund a virtual channel, $\rchi$, with $x$ coins.

In order to do this the participants will need three additional channels: a joint allocation channel, $J$, with participants $\{A, B, I\}$ and two guarantor channels $G$ and $G'$ which target $J$. The setup is shown in figure \ref{fig:virtual-channel-construction}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \input{figures/virtual-channels-construction}
  \caption{Virtual channel construction.}
  \label{fig:virtual-channel-construction}
\end{figure}

We will cover the steps for safely setting up this construction in section \ref{section:open-close-virtual-channel}. 
In the next section, we will explain why this construction can be considered to fund the channel $\rchi$.

\subsection{Offloading Virtual Channels}

Similarly to the method for ledger channel construction, we will show that the virtual channel construction funds $\rchi$ by demonstrating how any one of the participants can offload the channel $\rchi$, thereby converting it to an on-chain channel that holds its own funds.

We will first consider the case where $A$ wishes to offload $\rchi$. $A$ proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ starts by finalizing all their finalizable outcomes on-chain:
  \begin{align}
    \adj{\holds{L}{x}{\alloc{G:x}}, \; \holds{L'}{x}{}, \holds{G}{}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}, \; \holds{J}{}{\alloc{\rchi: x, I: x}}}
  \end{align}
  Although $A$ has the power to finalize $L$, $G$ and $J$, they are not able to finalize $L'$.
  Thankfully, this does not prevent them from offloading $\rchi$.
  \item $A$ then calls $\transfer{L}{G}{x}$ to move the funds from $L$ to $G$:
  \begin{align}
    \adj{\holds{L'}{x}{}, \holds{G}{x}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}, \; \holds{J}{}{\alloc{\rchi: x, I: x}}}
  \end{align}
  \item Finally $A$ calls $\claim{G}{A}{\rchi}$ to move the funds from $G$ to $\rchi$.
  \begin{align}
    \adj{\holds{L'}{x}{}, \holds{G}{}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}, \; \holds{J}{}{\alloc{I: x}}, \; \holds{\rchi}{x}{}}
  \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
As $G$ has $\rchi$ as top priority, the operation is successful.

By symmetry, the previous case also covers the case where $B$ wants to offload.
The final case to consider is the one where $I$ wants to offload the channel and reclaim their funds.
This is important to ensure that $A$ and $B$ cannot lock $I$'s funds indefinitely in the channel.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $I$ starts by finalizing all their finalizable outcomes on-chain:
  \begin{multline}
    \adj{\holds{L}{x}{\alloc{G:x}}, \; \holds{L'}{x}{\alloc{G':x}}, \holds{G}{}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}, \; \\\holds{G'}{}{\guar{J}{\rchi, B, I}}, \; \holds{J}{}{\alloc{\rchi: x, I: x}}}
  \end{multline}
  \item $I$ then transfers funds from the ledger channels to the virtual channels by calling $\transfer{L}{G}{x}$ and $\transfer{L'}{G'}{x}$:
  \begin{align}
    \adj{\holds{G}{x}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}, \; \holds{G'}{x}{\guar{J}{\rchi, B, I}}, \; \holds{J}{}{\alloc{\rchi: x, I: x}}}
  \end{align}
  \item Then $I$ claims on one of the guarantees, e.g. $\claim{G}{\rchi}{x}$ to offload $\rchi$:
  \begin{align}
    \adj{\holds{G}{}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}, \; \holds{G'}{x}{\guar{J}{\rchi, B, I}}, \; \holds{J}{}{\alloc{I: x}}, \; \holds{\rchi}{x}{}}
  \end{align}
  \item After which, $I$ can recover their funds by claiming on the other guarantee, $\claim{G'}{I}{x}$:
  \begin{align}
    \adj{\holds{G}{}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}, \; \holds{G'}{}{\guar{J}{\rchi, B, I}}, \;  \holds{\rchi}{x}{}, \; \holds{I}{x}{}}
  \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
Note that $I$ has to claim on both guarantees, offloading $\rchi$ before being able to reclaim their funds.
The virtual channel became a direct channel and the intermediary was able to recover their collateral.

\subsection{Examples}\label{section:open-close-virtual-channel}

In this section we present a sequence of network states written in terms of universally finalizable outcomes, where each state differs from the previous state only in one channel.

\subsubsection{Opening a Virtual Channel}

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{figures/opening-virtual-channel}}
  \caption{Opening a virtual channel}
  \label{fig:virtual-channel-opening}
\end{figure}

The procedure for opening a virtual channel is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start in the state given in equation (\ref{eq:virtual-channel-start-state}):
  \begin{align}
    & \adj{\holds{L}{x}{}, \holds{L'}{x}{}}\\
    & \finalizable{L}{\alloc{A:a, I:b}}{A, I} \\
    & \finalizable{L'}{\alloc{B: b, I: a}}{B, I}
  \end{align}
  \item $A$ and $B$ bring their channel $\rchi$ to the funding point:
  \begin{align}
    \finalizable{\rchi}{\alloc{A:a, B:b}}{A,B}
  \end{align}
  \item In any order, $A$, $B$ and $I$ setup the virtual channel construction:
  \begin{align}
    & \finalizable{J}{\alloc{A:a, B:b, I: x}}{A, B, I} \\
    & \finalizable{G}{\guar{J}{\rchi, A, I}}{A, I} \\
    & \finalizable{G'}{\guar{J}{\rchi, B, I}}{B, I}
  \end{align}
  \item In either order switch the ledger channels over to fund the guarantees:
  \begin{align}
    & \finalizable{L}{\alloc{G: x}}{A,I} \\
    & \finalizable{L'}{\alloc{G': x}}{B,I}
  \end{align}
  \item Switch $J$ over to fund $\rchi$:
  \begin{align}
    \finalizable{J}{\alloc{\rchi: x, I: x}}{A, B, I}
  \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
We give a visual representation of this procedure in figure \ref{fig:virtual-channel-opening}.

\subsubsection{Closing a Virtual Channel}

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{figures/closing-virtual-channel}}
  \caption{Closing a virtual channel}
  \label{fig:virtual-channel-closing}
\end{figure}

The same sequence of states, when taken in reverse, can be used to close a virtual channel:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Participants $A$ and $B$ finalize $\rchi$ by signing a conclusion proof:
  \begin{align}
    \finalizable{\rchi}{\alloc{A:a', B:b'}}{A,B}
  \end{align}
  \item $A$ and $B$ sign an update to $J$ to take account of the outcome of $\rchi$. $I$ will accept this update, provided that their allocation of $x$ coins remains the same:
  \begin{align}
    \finalizable{J}{\alloc{A: a', B:b', I: x}}{A, B, I}
  \end{align}
  \item In either order switch the ledger channels to absorb the outcome of $J$, defunding the guarantor channels in the process:
  \begin{align}
    & \finalizable{L}{\alloc{A: a', I: b'}}{A,I} \\
    & \finalizable{L'}{\alloc{B: b', I: a'}}{B,I}
  \end{align}
  \item The channels $\rchi$, $J$, $G$ and $G'$ are now all defunded, so can be discarded.
\end{enumerate}

It is also possible to do top-ups and partial checkouts from a virtual channel.

\subsubsection{Virtual Channel with Three Participants}

So far we have primarily focussed on channels with two participants.
The techniques here all generalise to $n$-participant channels.
In figure \ref{fig:virtual-channel-three-participants}, we give an example construction for a virtual channel between three participants.
The opening and closing of this channel follows the same pattern as the two participant case.

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\input{figures/virtual-channel-three-participants}}
  \caption{Virtual channel with three participants. Here $x = a + b + c$.}
  \label{fig:virtual-channel-three-participants}
\end{figure}
