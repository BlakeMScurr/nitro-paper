\section{Proofs of Construction}\label{sec:reasoning}


- what does safety mean?
- putting money into joint control. can I get some of it back if cooperation breaks down.








- paper aims to put in place a framework for reasoning about the correctness of state channel constructions
- reasoning about what I hold off-chain and what if means to me

- how to extract value
- states ---> outcomes ---> money
- reducing channel diagrams --> value

- outcome diagrams
- fundamental rule of state channels - if two states are worth the same, I will transition between them
- the "simple rule of state channels" - we ignore other factors
- value
- funded ?
- offloaded

- safe
- this is the guarantee that if a participant stops at any point other participants don't lose out

- allows rewriting
- [diagram] example: closing off-chain

- two questions (finalization + redistribution)
  - what can I definitely finalize?
  - what can I definitely redistribute to myself?

- protocol design: how can I move between states in single moves that keep the value the same
- .. when we don't allow atomic changes across channels

- presenting a construction / protocol
- in particular when presenting a protocol we must demonstrate a series single state updates, demonstrate that the value is preserved
- in particular the way we do this:
  - demostrate a construction funds a channel
  - demonstrate we can build it from another state
    - give a series of waypoint states - universally finalizable outcomes
    - of a special type of channel - consensus channels, running a particilar protocol
    - use the specifics of this channel to say we can move between them in a safe manner


\subsection{Finalizable outcomes}

- definition: statement
- definition: channel state
- definition: adjudicator state
- definition: system state

- the rules of strategies
